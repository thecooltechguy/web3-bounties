# web3-bounties
A trustless, on-chain protocol for securing smart contracts with code reviews & bug bounties.

## Note
This is an experiment to see if it's possible to use cryptoeconomics to audit smart contracts at scale, instead of relying on centralized auditing firms or bug bounty platforms.

Currently in development.
